Responsive Css Grid Framework - 

this is a simple yet useful responsive css3 and hmtl5 grid that is simply based on %.

this means that if you want to "col 100" covers entier parent width and "col 50" covers 50% etc.

this meas that that they can be used inside each-other however you want. Just make sure that each new (row) need a "col 100"

My own webpage is buit on the same framework www.fredrikk.co


best of luck!
